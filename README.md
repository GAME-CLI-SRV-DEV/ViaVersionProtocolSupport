# Pocket Edition Usage
Warning: it is intended to work as Extension of Geyser. Spigot and Sponge is not supported because ViaBedrock Which makes that plugin functional is for BE Servers.
it is also unstable!!! 

it also uses ViaLoader, so you can use Anykind of Geyser versions :skull:.\
but i dont recommend using randumb geyser versions as it would look very outdated.\

The GeyserMC Version Includes [Only Pocket Edition](https://github.com/KejonaMC/GeyserBlockJavaPlayers) Bypasser called ViaBedrock.\
Download VVPS-Geyser, put it in the GeyserMC Folder, Start the Geyser, Then you can use ViaBedrock On VIAaaS. :haha:
This Extension dont work with inventory. so, you have to get ViaVersionProtocolSupportGeyserStuff(Uses Commands to equip inventory)


# Standalone Usage
### using ViaProxy
put it in the plugins folder
ViaLoader is Not Supported yet.
# Inspired by ProtocolSupport
Thank you!

# Note:
exclude("io/lenni0451/optconfig/**") is put on ViaProxy Subproject
# Thanks to
[RaphiMC](https://github.com/RaphiMC) & [Lenni0451](https://github.com/Lenni0451) for making ViaLegacy(Library API for VVPS Protocol) & ViaBedrock(Library API for VVPSGE Protocol)\
[ViaBackwards](https://github.com/ViaVersion/ViaBackwards) For Template(Very Cool)
