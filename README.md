Spigot 1.4.4-1.6.4(VVPS-Spigot) or Paper 1.21.1(VVPS-Paper)

# Transition from ProtocolSupport
It's Easy. Put the plugin, Just Enable it.

# Do You Support Bedrock Edition(Pocket Edition) Directly?
Yes, But Only Sponge. See [This Pull](https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser/pull/4097) Why did ViaVersionProtocolSupport-Sponge Started to Include Geyser And Floodgate.

# Pocket Edition Usage
Warning: it is intended to work as Extension of Geyser. Spigot and Sponge is not supported because ViaBedrock Which makes that plugin functional is for BE Servers.
it is also unstable!!! 

it also uses ViaLoader, so you can use Anykind of Geyser versions :skull:.\
but i dont recommend using randumb geyser versions as it would look very outdated.\

The GeyserMC Version Includes [Only Pocket Edition](https://github.com/KejonaMC/GeyserBlockJavaPlayers) Bypasser called ViaBedrock.\
Download VVPS-Geyser, put it in the GeyserMC Folder, Start the Geyser, Then you can use ViaBedrock On VIAaaS. :haha:
This Extension dont work with inventory. so, you have to get ViaVersionProtocolSupportGeyserStuff(Uses Commands to equip inventory)


# Standalone Usage
### using ViaProxy
put it in the plugins folder.\
ViaLoader is Not Supported yet.

# Inspired by ProtocolSupport
Thank you.\
but rip bozo anyway :skull:

# Note:
exclude("net/raphimc/vialegacy/**") is put on ViaProxy Subproject.
# Thanks to
[RaphiMC](https://github.com/RaphiMC) & [Lenni0451](https://github.com/Lenni0451) for making ViaLegacy(Library API for VVPS Protocol) & ViaProxy\
[ViaBackwards](https://github.com/ViaVersion/ViaBackwards) For Template(Very Cool)
